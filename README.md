My first ever algorithm
It was exciting and a bit challenging I have learned so many things in linear regression. 
Heres a detailed explanation how my model works..
1) I have a line that passes through my data points and i have to find the best fit line for example the line having minimum error.
2) We find the best fit line by iterating the value of slope and y_intercept(y= mx + c).
# Different steps:
  Calculate the cost function.
  Calculate the gradient of the cost function aka slope hint(using chain rule)
  Use Gradient decendent to iterate the value of slope and y_intercept.
  
Learned all the depth intuition about these calculation and implent them in code using numpy.
Also performed linear regresiion with scikit learn
